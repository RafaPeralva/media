    <h3>Weight-ins:</h3>
    <h4 class="description">
      After days and months of preparation, fighters get together, the day
      before their fight, to hand in final paperwork needed for a fight and
      weigh themselves to make sure they are fighting at weight that was agreed
      upon. If both fighters weight at agreed weight, then they are ready to
      fight the next day. After weigh-ins, fighters like to go out and have a
      big meal since they spent so much time cutting weight.
