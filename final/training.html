    <h3>Training:</h3>
    <h4 class="description">
      Training for a fight requires a lot of effort both physically and mentally
      from fighters. It may take months to prepare for a single fight, not
      counting the years that are spent training before you can get matched up
      for a fight. However, many fighters will tell you that training is not the
      worst part, dieting and cutting weight are. Fighters drop crazy amount of
      weight for a fight, I've seen some dropping 15-20lbs in about a month.
      That requires a lot of discipline and will power from them.
