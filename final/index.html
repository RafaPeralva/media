    <h3>A fight gallery</h3>
    <h4 class="description">
      I have been doing martial arts in some way/shape/form since first grade. I
      started by training Judo in my school in Brazil and did so until 6th
      grade. In 2017 I started training Muay Thai. Last year I was able to start
      helping out with my gym and have been able to help with training and
      fights. I thought it would be a good idea to portray the fighters in a
      gallery that showed more than their "angry" faces but that also showed how
      hard they train and how much heart they put into this lifestyle.
