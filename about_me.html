        <h3>More about me:</h3>
        <p>
          I started doing Martial Arts when I was in 1st grade. I trained Judo
          from 1st grade through 6th grade. <br />
          I started taking Muay Thai class when I was 17 and still doing it to
          this day.<br />
          On my free time, I help manage my local Martial Arts gym and help my
          coach during my teammates training/fights and/or my coach's fights.
          <br />
          My goal is to fight in the next year or so once I'm cleared from my
          injuries. <br />
          I also help set up for our own fight event, Westchester Fight Night!
