        <ul> 
            <li> <h3>What constitutes a creative web project today?</h3> </li>
            <ul>
                I believe that a creative web project today is a project where there's a unique design that matches its theme in a way that
                no one else has ever done before. This can be achieved with different layout, use of colors and elements in new ways, etc. 
                Additionally, it is a project where there's a purpose such as to get a message accross, advertise, get people with the same
                ideas together, etc. A creative web project is a way of expression that can be used by itself or with other means of expression such as art, music, videos... and many others.

            <li> <h3>How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform? </h3></li>
            <ul>
                I think that the web can be a great way to express who we are and the opportunities are endless. 
                I hope that I will be able to use it to express my ideas and share my thoughts and experiences.
            
            </ul>
            <li><h3>What are your goals in this course?</h3></li>
            <ul>
                My goals in this course are to be able to learn more about building websites. 
                I have had experience as a software engineer and I am really interested in front-end development and this class seemed like a good way to practice the skills I have and also to learn more.
