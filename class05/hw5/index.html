      Excerpt from The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie (pgs. 532-533)

      <span class="lefty">
        On the last night of his life he heard a noise like a giant crushing a
        forest beneath his feet, and smelled a stench like the giant's fart, and
        he realized that the tree was <a class="red">burning</a>. He got out of
        his chair and staggered dizzily down to the
        <a class="green">garden</a> to watch the fire, whose flames were
        consuming histories, memories, genealogies, purifying the earth, and
        coming towards him to set <span class="blue"> him free;</span>
      </span>

      <span class="fix">
        -- because the wind was blowing the fire towards the grounds of the
        mansion, so soon enough, soon enough, it would be his turn.
        <br />
        He saw the tree explode into a thousand fragments, and the trunk crack,
        like a <span class="love">heart</span>;
        <br />
        then he turned away and reeled towards the place in the garden where
        Ayesha had first caught his eye;
        <br />
        -- and now he felt a slowness come upon him, a great heaviness, and he
        lay down on the withered dust. <br />
        Before his eyes closed he felt something brushing at his lips, and saw
        the little cluster of butterflies struggling to enter his mouth.
        <br />
        Then the sea poured over him, and he was in the water beside Ayesha, who
        had stepped miraculously out of his wife's body ...

        "Open," she was crying. "Open wide!" Tentacles of light were flowing
        from her navel and he chopped at them, chopped, using the side of his
        hand.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Open," she screamed. "You've come this far, now do the rest." -- How
        could he hear her voice? --
        <br />
        They were under
        <span class="water">water</span>, lost in the roaring of the sea, but he
        could hear her clearly, they could all hear her, that voice like a bell.
        <br />
        "Open," she said. He closed.
